    "Lisa was at home on her computer when suddenly Netflix stopped working. It kept giving her a weird 404 error message. She tried to refresh the page, even restarted her computer.",
    "Next Lisa tried Hulu, but that was down as well. She checked her gmail but there was a connectivity issue making it to where she could not receive any incoming emails or view her saved emails. ‘What the heck is going on?!’ Suzie yelled.",
    "’The cloud must be down!’, Lisa thought to herself.",
    "Lisa could not imagine being stuck inside without a working phone, computer, or tablet. The internet sends little peices of information from the cloud to our devices and With the cloud down, the internet was having issues accessing this information.",
    // checkpoint - what does the cloud do
    "Clouds are up high in the sky, but when you think about the cloud you should image a large data server.",
    // checkpoint - what is the cloud
    "The cloud has locations all over the world.",
    // checkpoint - where is the cloud
    "Suzie was determined to fix this mess. She needed to finish watching Ozark so she could talk about it with her friends on their next Zoom call.",
    "With the internet barley working Suzie had to do some old school research. She found the phone number and location of the nearest cloud data center. After giving them a call, she found out that the data center was under a phishing attack. ‘How is this possible?’ Suzie asked herself.",
    "Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers",
     // checkpoint - what is a phising attack
    "The cloud is owned by individuals and companies. The security of the cloud however it up to the companies.",
    // checkpoint - who owns the cloud
    "Thankfully Suzie knew how to handle this! She wrote a foolproof malware detection script for her CyberSecurity class last semester. She was certain that if the data center only used her script they could protect themselves from the phishing attacks and get the cloud back up and running.",
    "Will Lisa get the cloud back up and running before it is too late? Stay tuned for chapter two, coming out later this month!"]
