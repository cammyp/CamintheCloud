        "Cameron was at home when she got an angry call from her boss. “Cameron you said the app would be ready today! Where is the app?”  Cameron was confused, she had uploaded the app to the App Store last night.￼ “Let me troubleshoot and see what’s going on.” Cameron said.",
        "She went to the App Store and downloaded the app. She opened the app and found that none of the content was loading. Since the app is available for download, but the data in the app was not loading Cameron knew something was wrong with the app's database connection.",
        "With all the data and files you have access to, there is no possible way to store that information on your physical device. The cloud stores and accesses data and programs over the Internet. When you think of the cloud you can imagine a gigantic server-farm infrastructure.",
        "Clouds are up high in the sky, but the cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. Despite being held in the cloud, your data still needs to be physically stored on a device somewhere. Unfortunately, you will never truly know where your data is unless you do some digging.",
        "Servers may be in China, the UK or anywhere else in the world. Cameron needed to figure out why the AWS data center was not allowing her data to be accessed. She needed to figure this out or her boss would be very upset with her!",
        "After doing a couple hours of research Cameron found that one specific AWS data center in North Virginia was experiencing an outage. Not only did their power fail but their back up generators failed as well. This means that anyone trying to use the app has no access to its data",
        "Cameron immediately called her boss to inform her of the situation. This is an extremely rare situation boss lady. The cloud is amazing tool for storing and accessing information and rarely has issues. It should only be down for a couple of hours.",
        "About four hours later the app was being used by customers all around the world! The cloud was back up and running and providing people with all the information they desire!",
