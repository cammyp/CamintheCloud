        "Suzie was at home on her computer when suddenly Netflix stopped working. It kept giving her a weird 404 error message. She tried to refresh the page, even restarted her computer.",
        "Still, nothing worked. Next she tried Hulu, but that was down as well.",
        "She checked her gmail but there was a connectivity issue making it to where she could not received any incoming emails or view her saved emails.",
        "‘What the heck is going on?!’ Suzie yelled. ’The cloud must be down’, Suzie thought to herself. With the cloud down, the internet was having issues accessing information.",
        "Suzie could not imagine being stuck inside with no iPhone, computer, or tablet.",
        "Pretend your device is a little black box. It preforms tasks for you, but you aren’t quite sure how it works.",
        "You can think of the cloud as a black box. It gives the internet all the information it needs in a really complex and intricate way.",
        "Suzie was determined to fix this mess. She needed to finish watching Ozark so she could talk about it with her friends on their next Zoom call.",
        "The cloud needs large spaces, like warehouses, to hold all of its data servers. These warehouses need good air conditioning systems and lots of power.",
        "There are multiple clouds all around the United States and around the world.",
        "With the internet barley working Suzie had to do some old school research. She found the phone number and location of the nearest cloud data center.",
        "After giving them a call, she found out that the data center was under a phishing attack.",
        "‘How is this possible?’ Suzie asked herself. While the cloud is owned by everyone, yourself and companies included, data centers are usually owned by companies.",
        "Making the security of the cloud only as good as the security of the individual companies.",
        "Thankfully Suzie knew how to handle this! She wrote a foolproof malware detection script for her CyberSecurity class last semester.",
        "She was certain that if the data center only used her script they could protect themselves from phishing attacks and get the cloud back up and running."
